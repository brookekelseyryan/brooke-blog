                        How do our distinctly human cognitive capabilities arise from the connections between the billions of neurons in the brain? What are the computational properties that enable precise yet generalizable knowledge about the world to be represented amongst neural connections? How does the symphony of internal experience arise from the architectures governing discrete regions of brain function? Such are the questions that fundamentally drive my curiosity and passion for exploring the brain, mind, and artificial representations of intelligence.                     <p class="mt-4 mb-4 justify-research domainesanstextlight">

                    My research leverages computational, behavioral, and neuroimaging techniques aimed at understanding the mechanisms that give rise to our uniquely human cognitive abilities. I am particularly interested in leveraging brain-like, high-parameter artificial neural networks, as they are fruitful for utilizing naturalistic, high-dimensional behavioral datasets that are more akin to real-life experience. I also find such models to be interesting due to their potentially mechanistic explanations for how higher-order cognition may arise from the organization of neurons.                     <p class="mt-4 mb-4 domainesanstextlight justify-research">

                    In my current work, I am exploring areas of human intelligence that surpass state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, such as language acquisition, inductive biases in neural architectures, and predicting human behavior in low-data regimes. Below are my past research projects and publications, which additionally span topics including Computer Science education and Computer Vision.
