Despite the criticality of this skill in a budding software engineer, reading code—and more specifically, techniques on how to read code when integrating oneself into a large existing software project—is often neglected in the typical software engineering education. As part of a new professional Master of Software Engineering at the University of California, Irvine, we designed and delivered a “reading to write code” course from the ground up. Titled Reverse Engineering and Modeling, the course introduces students to techniques they can use to become familiar with a large code base, so they are able to make meaningful contributions. In this paper, we briefly introduce the Master program and its underlying philosophy, articulate the course’s learning outcomes, present the design of the course, and provide a detailed reflection on our experiences in terms of what went well, what did not go well, what we do not know yet, and what our next steps are in preparing for the forthcoming incarnation of the course in Spring 2022. In so doing, we hope to provide a baseline together with lessons learned for others who may be interested in instituting a similar course at their institution. },}                Projects:                         The Electric Garden/ El Jardín Eléctrico    :     Brooke K.

    "title": "Two Ways to Sync Your Zotero Group Library in Overleaf",
    "body": "2022/06/08 - Here’s a very quick guide on how to connect your Zotero Group Library to Overleaf. I have used the alternative solution detailed below in the past when the default “From Zotero” integration in Overleaf did not work for me. I wanted to post this as a reference—for myself, because I always forget how to do this when I’m about to write a paper—and also in case it happens to be useful for anyone else. Import from ZoteroFirst, you should try to import your Zotero group bibliography the “usual” way. To do this, click on “New File”, and select “From Zotero. ” You’ll select the appropriate Library from here.   To get to this dialog, select  New File  from your project page. After, your bibliography should appear in your project page:  Most of the time this should work, but I have had an issue on at least one project where this method didn’t work. The second methodology listed below will help in those cases. Import from External URLIf the first method didn’t work, here’s an easy workaround. Navigate to the same “New File” dialog, but then click “From External URL. ” Using the url https://api. zotero. org/groups/INSERT_GROUPID/items/top?format=bibtex&amp;style=numeric&amp;limit=100, and replacing the INSERT_GROUPID with the appropriate ID from the desired Zotero group, you should be able to import your bibliography this way.   Use the url https://api. zotero. org/groups/INSERT_GROUPID/items/top?format=bibtex&amp;style=numeric&amp;limit=100 in the From External URL option. Example: To get the group ID from your Zotero group, you’ll need to go onto your Zotero account on the web interface. For instance, my group library AI Education Project is hosted at https://www. zotero. org/groups/4669023/ai_education_project. The Group ID in this case is the number hash after the groups/, part of the URL, in this case, 4669023. In order for this workaround to be successful, the Zotero group settings need to be set to “Public. ” In the example I’m using, my group type was Public and the Membership was closed.   Group settings on Zotero must be Public. Now, go back into Overleaf and paste in this URL with the group ID you just retrieved into the “From External URL” form.   Pasting the group ID, 4669023, into the URL: https://api. zotero. org/groups/4669023/items/top?format=bibtex&amp;style=numeric&amp;limit=100Then, navigating to our Overleaf project, we see that the file ai_education_project. bib was successfully imported!  ConclusionHopefully this guide helped anyone who is on a paper deadline and wants to import their group bibliography in an efficient workflow. Happy paper writing! ReferencesI initially saw this tip written about buried at the bottom of blog post written by Yuxuan Mei [1]. Since I believe this tip is so useful, and in that post its just included at the very bottom, I wanted to make a post dedicated to it entirely for clarity.

    "title": "How to Find an Easy First Issue in an Open-Source GitHub Project",
    "body": "2022/05/21 - As a new developer to an open-source project, it can be quite intimidating to figure out where to begin, particularly for your first contribution to the project. And the first step before even doing your first contribution is actually finding that first issue to work on—a task which I’ve found is often underestimated for its difficulty. While there do exist many blog posts on this issue, they tend to begin and end at filtering the list of issues by using the “good first issue” label on GitHub. However, as we will see in the example we’ll walk through, that doesn’t universally work for all open-source projects—and beginners are then left in the dust about what to do next. My goal with this post is to demonstrate for you how you’re going to be walking through a given open source project to identify a couple of “easy” first issues to work on. I will also walk you through some of the nuances of issues, and importantly the social context of the project, and how these play an important role in navigating your open-source project of choice. Context and PrerequisitesI wrote this blog post as an adaptation of a lecture segment I’ve given in the Reverse Engineering and Modeling course at UC Irvine with Professor André van der Hoek, where we teach students how to become productive contributors to large, unfamiliar software systems. In fact, we even wrote a paper on that course that appeared in the International Conference on Software Engineering! So, I’m writing this post for an audience similar to our student cohort in the Professional Master of Software Engineering program—folks who already know how to program, but maybe have not had much experience working in an open-source system. I’m also assuming that you already have an open-source project of choice to work on. (If this is something you need help with, let me know in the comments and I can work on this as a related post!) The open source project I’m going to be using to walk through is Tensorflow. It’s an open-source library for Deep Learning that is written mostly in C++ and is maintained by Google. If that sounds super scary, don’t worry—I’m using this as the example project mainly because of the abundance of activity the project has so that I can demonstrate various scenarios you may encounter. Even if you are working in a project that is a completely different language or product, all these same tips should still apply.   TensorFlow GitHub project page. Why do we need to vet the issues at all?It seems like so much extra effect to go through all this detective work to find “the best” issue to work on, so why should we even bother? Why not just start coding on the first issue we see? The biggest reason why we need to actually vet the issues before we begin working on one is because anyone can post an issue to GitHub. It can be hard, I think, for newcomers to open-source to understand this. When you’re a beginner, its easy to assume that everyone active on the GitHub page is official and knows what they’re doing. Let’s look at a few real, mostly silly examples from the Tensorflow page itself to show you this is definitely not the case: Bad Issue Example 1: An Angry Customer:   TensorFlow issue #77. Here’s an example that made me chuckle. This individual is demanding “1st class windows support” be provided. This is obviously an example of something that cannot actually be coded up in the scope of a simple GitHub issue, but perhaps was an individual airing their greivances in a misguided forum. Maybe instead of GitHub, they could have found the TensorFlow customer support page? Bad Issue Example 2: Red Alert! Unrelated webpage down!:   TensorFlow issue #209. Red alert! The personal webpage for a professor is DOWN! Now, I’m not being entirely fair putting this in the bad issue section. For context, Yann LeCun is a professor of Computer Science, and he is one of the original creators of the MNIST database, which is an important database that TensorFlow gives their users access to. At least as of this writing, there are examples of TensorFlow’s official documentation pointing to the dataset hosted on Professor LeCun’s webpage. Despite the relevancy of this webpage to the TensorFlow project, this is not a good example of an issue you’d want to find yourself blindly working on as a newcomer to the project. How would someone even go about fixing this without access to LeCun’s webpage code? This is a good one to leave to the project maintainers to figure out. Bad Issue Example 3: “Good First Issue” that is actually mega-hard:   TensorFlow issue #22926. At first glance, its not really obvious why this issue belongs in this list. This issue (as of the time of writing), is actually still open on the TensorFlow page. For an issue to be open for nearly 4 years is almost unheard of in the fast-paced world of open-source. As we scroll down perusing the comments on this issue, we find lots of moderators and experienced developers trying to gain more context about how to both understand and reproduce the issue—a critical component we’ll discuss more later on. About halfway through the comments, we stumble upon a comment from a user @Gomesz785 that aptly summarizes the theme here:   TLDR: A good Samaritan user warns newcomers that despite the  good first issue  label, this is actually a  god-level  issue. Silly examples aside, this is actually my favorite example because it really drives home the true reason why we can’t always just “trust” minimal filtering of issues. Summary: So, to summarize, here’s why it’s not the best idea to grab the first issue we see on the project:  Anyone can post an issue Big projects like on Tensorflow have dozens of posts weekly Could be that someone just didn’t understand how the feature worked Could be some setting on their local machine Maybe they didn’t have the proper dependencies installed Could be a bug Could be a feature request! (generally more work)A Heuristic to Search for Easy IssuesOk so there’s a lot of potential reasons why we shouldn’t just grab the first random issue we see. But what is it we do want to be looking for instead? And how can we go about this process? In this section, I’m going to outline a heuristic for finding a suitable easy issue. I’ll walk through each step/theme in detail with TensorFlow, and then at the bottom I’ll leave an action-item you can try in your chosen open-source system alongside. Documentation: The Information Kiosk of Open-Source: I like to think of documentation in an open-source GitHub project as the equivalent of the Information Kiosk or Customer Service desk. This is the easy, no-brainer, first-stop we’re going to to get some information. Are they always 100% right? Certainly not, we can all think of examples where Customer Service has given us well-intended, but ultimately misguided information about how to proceed on a given topic. But usually, the Information Kiosk is going to have the latest company-provided information on a variety of different topics.   Information kiosk from one of my favorite childhood games, Rollercoaster Tycoon. From RedditIn TensorFlow, and in many open-source projects, the guidelines for contributors can be found in a doc titled CONTRIBUTING. md. Taking a look at the below snippet from the Contribution doc for TensorFlow:  If you want to contribute, start working through the TensorFlow codebase, navigate to the Github “issues” tab …start by trying one of the smaller/easier issues here i. e.  issues with the “good first issue” label and then take a look at the issues with the “contributions welcome” label. But, when we go to the Issues tab for TensorFlow and search by “Good First Issue”, we are actually only left with one issue, and this is the same god-level issue we talked about above. So, unfortunately, for TensorFlow, our Information Kiosk was not particularly trustworthy on this topic. One of the most important things you’ll learn from working on enough open-source, is that the code is always the ultimate source of truth. Documentation is nice, sometimes it looks really official, but it is subject to being out-of-date or flat-out wrong. Action Item: For your open source project: go ahead and try this first step. Look at the documentation for Contributors, and if they suggest that you look at issues by the common “Good First Issue” or “Contributions Welcome” labels, go ahead and actually try filtering the Issues with these. Take note of what is left, and whether its several issues, or not many at all like in this case.  When applying this in Tensorflow, here’s what we have. Easy Bugs: The White Whale of Open-Source Issues: Fundamentally, what we’re really looking for when we’re trying to find an “easy first issue”, is actually an “easy bug. ” Why not Features?: Generally, we’re going to want to avoid features at this point. If its your very first contribution, bug fixes are generally going to be less involved, require less familiarity with the code base, and will be a great way to gain expertise in your given project. Working on a Feature would be a great goal for a second or third contribution later on! What makes a bug an “easy bug”?: An “easy bug” does not necessarily mean that its easy to fix. In this context, an easy bug means the following:  Specific: Usually in the official formatting as outlined in the documentation of the repository Reproducible: We have precise steps outlined for us to reproduce this issue on our own machine Some official recognition from admins: Shows that someone else has been able to reproduce the issue on their own machineSo, an “easy bug” in this case is really easy to spot and reproduce on your machine. How difficult it actually is to fix is something that you can try to decipher by reading the comments for the given issue, and mostly by working on the bug itself.   Mr. Krabs and his elusive white whale, Moby Dollar. From YouTubeA quick and dirty way to find bugs is to simply use the label for it in GitHub. Usually, its titled “Bugs”, or something like that. In TensorFlow, its actually titled “type:bug. ” Now, this will filter all the issues just categorized as “bug”, but they are certainly not automatically meeting the criteria of an “easy bug” listed above. I call it a “white whale” because for it to meet all of these criteria can actually be quite rare. In TensorFlow, here’s an example of a bug that meets our criteria of an “easy bug. ” Action Item: In your open-source project issues list from above, now apply the label “Bugs” (or whatever the equivalent is in your project) and see what you’re left with. We’re going to narrow down this list further in the next step, so don’t filter out by “easy bugs” just quite yet.  Since the list from TensorFlow above only contained 1 issue, I’m going to clear those two “good first issue” and “contributions welcome” labels. Applying only the “type:bugs” label, here’s what we have for TensorFlow at this point. Releases: The Fountain of Youth: There’s a lot of issues in a given GitHub project that are inevitably out-of-date. Even if we do find our precious Easy Bug, how can we tell which ones are still relevant to us? The quick and easy answer to this: look at the latest Release. For any open-source project, the latest Release contains the most recent version of the project’s code. The reason that the latest release is going to be the best place to look for bugs essentially comes down to the Reproducible criteria we discussed above for Easy Bugs. Even if we have a perfectly outlined bug, if all the instructions for reproducing that bug are related to code from 7 releases ago, how can we be sure this is still relevant? By grabbing issues that are related to the latest release, we can be sure that the information provided with it and the code we write are going to be most relevant to the current state of the project. For TensorFlow, and many projects on GitHub, there should be a /releases pages we can look at. Here’s the Release page for TensorFlow, where we can find the number of the latest release. Usually its going to be some number with decimals. In TensorFlow, they actually have labels for each release. We find the label corresponding with the latest release number to further filter our issues. Action Item: Depending on the conventions of the project you’re working on, there could be several different ways we can filter issues by the release.  One way, if its like TensorFlow, is through labels. If this is the case, simply find the label corresponding to the most recent release, and filter your list even further.  If your project does not use Labels corresponding to the Release on the Issues page, try digging around your project documentation to see if there is a way that they separate out issues with the corresponding Release.  If all else fails, look at the date of the latest release on the Releases page of your project. Then, look at issues only posted after this date.  For TensorFlow, here’s our filtered list at this point. This is pretty incredible, we started with over 2,000 open issues, and we’ve filtered it down to just 6!And finally, the moment we’ve all been waiting for!: At this point in the process, if you’ve been following along with the Action Items at the end of each heuristic, you should have a much more manageable list of Issues left. At this point, with the issues you have left, you’re going to want to more carefully apply the criteria for an Easy Bug we discussed above. As long as you find something that mostly meets this criteria, you should be good to go ahead and start actually coding on this! Parting AdviceRemember, this is a heuristic—its not meant to be an exact replica of steps you can duplicate for any open-source system. There might be things you have to tweak—for instance, you might have to include the latest few releases, instead of just the latest one in order to find an appropriate open issue to work on. One of my favorite experts on the practice, Joshua Bloch, aptly puts it:  “Learning the art of programming, like most other disciplines, consists of first learning the rules and then learning when to break them. ” So, hopefully these general steps will give you a much more thorough and nuanced outline in order to start contributing to your open-source system, but they will not ever be a 100% exact process to duplicate.

    "title": "Bored to Death: Why Working as a Software Engineer Nearly Cost Me My Life",
    "body": "2021/11/01 - I’m often asked by my students how I wound up in grad school, and especially why I chose to come to academia when I had a prestigious, 6-figure job in tech right out of undergrad. Sometimes even my fellow grad students will ask me this question after I declare my goal is to one day become a professor—why not just go to industry where I’ll make way more money doing “the same” work? I was inspired to write about this because I’ve been listening to this wonderful podcast that I discovered recently (thanks in part to our reptilian algorithm overlords) called ADHD reWired with Eric Tivers. I’ve been listening to episode after episode of brilliant, successful, and happy individuals with ADHD talk about their life story and rise to success. Oftentimes though, these folks had to go through really dark periods in their lives before they were able to learn to “ride the dragon” of the brain that is ADHD. When I applied for the NSF GRFP earlier this month, the personal statement I wrote for it required me to do some deep thinking about why I really was in academia, and why I wanted to pursue a PhD. A big part of my essay that I worked on was talking about how I re-found myself and my true interests while I was backpacking along the John Muir Trail. This really did happen, and honestly it kind of sounds like a movie—I had recurring dreams nearly nightly on the month-long trip about my love of science and teaching, and that my years of self-doubt in the field of computer science had made me forget my true, original dream to one day become a college professor. (I plan on posting my essay later if I get the fellowship, fingers crossed!) What that story didn’t cover, however, is why was I really was even on the JMT in the first place? This isn’t something you do on a weekend, most people can’t walk the trail while having full-time employment—it takes about 20-30 days for a backpacker to walk the 211 miles it spans.     View this post on Instagram      A post shared by JMT Hiker (@hikers_of_the_jmt)  After listening to the stories in the podcast, I realized there was more to my own “origin story” than I’d initially talked about. A big goal in my writing is to broaden access in the field, and I’ve had some recent realizations about how many of my struggles to fit in in Computer Science were not solely due to the fact that I am a queer woman in a predominantly cis-masculine hetero-normal field, but also because of the unique set of challenges that having an ADHD brain presents itself with. There’s so much to this story that I want to cover, and I probably will be doing more posts about this. But for now, the story that answers: why did I leave industry and end up in academia? For prior context, in many software engineering teams, work is broken into what is called in Agile Methodology “sprints. ” Engineers are assigned a certain number of small tasks to be completed during this time period, typically about a two week long period. The amount of tasks they get assigned is dependent upon level of familiarity with the system and often seniority. So, a UC San Diego recent graduate, assigned a couple easy bugs a sprint and being paid an astronomically high salary at a resume-making tech company—its the dream gig, right? For many of my fellow 22-year old peers who’d also scored a highly competitive, six-figure job right out of college, this was an easy-coasting ride on the gravy train. I saw friends in my cohort who absolutely crushed this game, I saw several rise to the coveted rank of senior and even staff level positions in under a year. So what was Brooke doing during a typical sprint, 6 months into her tenure? Hunched over in my dimly-lit corner cubicle, this particular sprint, I was hard at work. Not exactly doing any bug fixes, or new feature requests, or really any programming at all. No, a task much more important than this had me absolutely fixated. I spent an entire two week period—the length of the an entire agile “sprint” in that company—researching the best dog food for my new puppy Henry. During our team’s morning stand-up meetings, I literally would report imaginary roadblocks I was facing to justify why this task that was supposed to take a few hours was now taking the entire sprint: “Yeah, we gotta loop Mark down in IT on this one, this issue is looking a lot more complicated than we initially budgeted for. ” But really, “Mark in IT” was the author of a book on naturopathic dog food. I would scuffle back to my desk, anytime a senior teammate walked by I’d pull up the code I hadn’t touched since it was assigned weeks ago, and go back to spending the entire day researching dog food. I did not get my work done at the end of the sprint, but I was now an expert on DIY raw natural dog food. Even after all this, Henry actually wouldn’t be any better off either, I realized because of the time involved in implementing all the “best” methodologies (I could barely clean up my own plates after dinner, how the hell was I going to do it for a dog), this would be totally unrealistic to even attempt. Henry just eats kibble now.   My dog Henry and me at the beach. This cycle went on for nearly a year. Nine and a half days of dicking around at my desk, then the last half-day of the sprint when the literal fear of god and unemployment were in my veins that I would be able to have the energy to start on my tasks. And unsurprisingly, as probably any working software engineer can attest, tasks are almost always significantly more complicated and time-consuming than originally estimated, and often I’d have nothing completed at the end of a sprint. “What the fuck was wrong with me?” I would think on a daily basis. I didn’t like lying to my team, hell I didn’t even really intend to in the first place. I knew this task wasn’t supposed to take me very long. But I just could not get myself interested in what I was “supposed” to be doing. Often unconsciously, I would get sucked in to whatever interested me at the time—one moment it might be dog food, other times it might be ultralight backpacking gear. It was really only when the assigned work intrinsically interested me where I was able to actually produce work that matched my capabilities. After a few good weeks, inevitably, I’d get sucked into something tangentially related to the project, such as researching the best possible testing framework, learning the theoretical underpinnings of cybersecurity despite being irrelevant for the looming project milestones. Those “little” but ever-important tasks would catch up to me, and I’d have nothing to show for it. I felt dishonest, like I was letting both my team and myself down. No matter how “simple” the task appeared, the endless monotony of working in a large, risk-averse, decades-old legacy system was slowly killing me. Despite the brilliant marketing that tech companies have produced to make software engineering seem fast-paced, cutting-edge, and dare I say sexy, I found myself slowly drowning in a sea of self-hate and office mundanity. Why the fuck is it so hard for me to just fix a simple bug? Why can’t I just be a functional adult? In my efforts to force myself to fit that neurotypical mold was when things became dangerous for me. As the months carried on, little was able to capture my attention at all. Towards the end of my brief tenure at this company, I had to have my mother drive me to work because I would sob the entire way there. At lunch, I’d go off-campus somewhere and sob. On the last day in the office, I felt like I had physically left my body. An empty shell of my former joyful, jovial self, the only thing that could capture my focus now were things that could harm myself, like maybe that plastic butter knife in the break room… Hearing myself think that, I left work, and went immediately to my doctor, who put me on a medical leave of absence. It took me about a year and a half after that dark, gray day to find what I really wanted to do. For a while, that was nothing. I was able to use the funds I’d saved from working that job to take time off to backpack. While I had no trouble with my resume getting interviews from more tech companies (I got flown up to Google during this period), the only job that remotely interested me was a summer teaching job I eventually I stumbled upon for Girls Who Code. By that time I’d committed to doing the John Muir Trail that August, so a seasonal gig was an accidental perfect fit for me at the time.   Group picture from Summer 2019 with Girls Who Code. In my dreams at night along the trail, I recalled the joy I experienced teaching those girls that summer. I didn’t have very good grades in college because of my undiagnosed ADHD—the last-minute cramming that’d gotten me A’s in high school didn’t work for me anymore with college-level programming assignments. I usually got Bs and Cs in my Computer Science classes, and so I never thought I’d be “good enough” to get into graduate school, a pre-requisite for teaching at the college level. My dreams along the JMT transported me to a time long before I thought I was inadqeuate to become a professor. I’m still discovering so much more about my own mind. I’ve also learned that women are generally underdiagnosed with ADHD because we tend to internalize the symptoms rather than realize we may need to seek professional help (Jessica from How to ADHD has a great video on this phenomenon). Sometimes, its not just a toxic internal dialogue but also an external one, I believe that being a queer woman in Computer Science just exacterbated these feelings of isolation and unworthiness. I’ve discovered, as I did on the JMT, that being a teacher is an integral part of my identity. I love the joyful process of scientific investigation and I love learning. I love the creativity and freedom that crafting my own research agenda and experiments affords. I love the diversity of the kinds of work I get to do in a day—I can tutor students, craft engaging lectures, create my own software framework from the ground-up to conduct my neural networks experiments, travel the world to present my research findings, ponder whether silicon will ever acquire consciousness. It might not sound like a huge difference to my neurotypical peers, but even just having the ability to truly, deeply focus on work that interests me without having to be interrupted by the thousands of little-deaths of Slack notifications, emails, “brief” meetings that take twice as long to “unwind” from and regain focus again—this is also part of the freedom that I love being in academia. The only “boss” I have to explain my working habits to really is the scorecard at the end of the year, wherein my objective output in terms of research or teaching productivity is measured. Not whether I punched in on-time every morning at 9 and clocked out at 6. I don’t have to explain to anyone that talking a 2 hour walk in the park in the middle of the day to stare at the geese is a crucial part of my daily routine—of course depending on what day it is, and perhaps whether listening to a podcast about UFOs or reading a book about the mysterious origins of eels might be more fun that day. The greater salary potential in industry is nothing compared to this. As Eric Tivers of ADHD reWired put it so aptly, ADHDers don’t have the luxury of doing work that is uninteresting to them. We have to find work that interests us in order to survive. I’m still learning so much about myself and what “it” is that I truly want to do in this life. I’ve learned I cannot tame the dragon that is ADHD, but I’ve learned I can ride it to where my interests take me. Right now, they’ve taken me to academia, studying neural networks and pondering the nature of consciousness, while teaching Software Engineering courses at UCI through my TAship I’ve been so lucky to acquire. I’ve had a lifelong love of teaching, I know I will continue to be guided there. I love learning, science, discovery, and helping others along the way. From my point of view right now on my “dragon”, a professorship is faintly outlined on the horizon, before that, the mountains of a PhD. And the only compass that I have is not that where the money lies, or where the security is, or where the most prestige lies, but where the beautiful beast of my interests take me. It is the only compass I need, and it is why I was led to where I am in grad school right now. Further Resources: If you read this and related to many of the symptoms discussed, please connect with a psychiatrist and get the help you deserve. Many people with ADHD are not diagnosed until later in life, particularly for women. Receiving the proper treatment can be life-changing, and I highly reccommend you seek professional help if you believe you may also have this. If you are also a college student who already has an ADHD diagnosis, this podast from ADHD reWired has some really helpful resources about self-advocacy and accommodations. Finally, if you are experiencing similar symptoms of depression or suicidal thoughts like I discussed in this post, please seek help! Even if you do not have health insurance, many therapists offer sliding-scale for low-income patients. If you are a college or graduate student, many universities provide mental health services that are included in the cost of tuition. In last resort scenarios, the Suicide Prevention Hotline can help you if you are in an emergency situation, and can also be reached at 1-800-273-8255. Future Posts: If you enjoyed this post, please let me know in the forum or reactions below! In a future post, I’d love to talk more about my personal journey of accepting my ADHD, as well as strategies I’ve used to help me in school and get good grades. If these ideas interest you, or if you have another idea for a post topic, please comment and let me know! "

    "title": "Stealing Code—What All Software Engineering Students Should Know",
    "body": "2021/01/25 - One of the most important principles you’ll in Software Engineering, is to leverage existing source code. As a rule of thumb, if you’re writing something completely from scratch, you’re probably doing it wrong! It can feel like a strange transition to deliberately copy another’s code as an end to your own means, a vast departure from the world of academia and introductory Computer Science courses, where you are mandated to write low-level code and prohibited from copying others’ solutions. However for most programming you’ll be doing in the Software industry as a whole, you will not be re-inventing the wheel, and its oftentimes better to use these pre-written libraries. Why is this? Its not necessarily that Software shuns original, independent thinking. Take the JSON-Java project, for instance.  Looking at their GitHub project page, this is a library that is used by at least 137,000 projects–and has a team of 41 developers working on maintaining the code.    JSON Java GitHub project contributors and users. Software is constantly evolving, new bugs appear as quickly as their predecessors squashed, dependencies are continuously updated—a project as large as this one is verified not only by the team of developers that maintain it, but by the hundreds of thousands of other open-source projects currently leveraging it successfully.  There’s always a risk of bugs—but such a project will likely have infrastructure in place such as Issue Tracking to capture and assess defects.  If there’s a common operation to be performed in the scope of JSON parsing and processing, its likely been implemented, through several rounds of releases and testing, and is still being actively watched and maintained by this large development group.  Generally, this example demonstrates why we prefer to leverage existing libraries to writing our own completely from scratch. Nuances: There are always exceptions to the rule, as Joshua Bloch’s famously puts it in Effective Java: “Learning the art of programming, like most other disciplines, consists of first learning the rules and then learning when to break them. ” Generally, we want to keep dependencies on outside libraries to a minimum—particularly when considering a large project like the JSON project. Really what we’re trying to do is mitigate the risk that introducing new, minimally tested, potentially bug-prone code can do to the project. So while we don’t want to “reinvent the wheel”, we do want to ensure that we’re looking for that wheel with progressive effort—first check the garage for spares, then in the auto shop down the street, then if we have to, shipping it in from out of state.  Taking the Java-JSON project, here is a general heuristic I would follow:    First, check to see if what you’re looking to do exists already inside of the JSON project.  This is the most preferred as it will minimize the amount of new code introduced to the project.     For source code (i. e. code in the “src/main” directory):      Java built-in libraries, which are included java. util, java. lang, java. io, and the likes.    Utilize code from libraries that the project already depends on.  You can see these in the pom. xml file under the tag, or in the build. gradle file under dependencies{. . . }.    Well-established third-party java libraries that are not already included as a project dependency, such as Google Guava.  Code such as this is tested almost as much as the java libraries themselves, and hardly introduces a risk to the project.       For test code (“src/test” directory):      Look at existing tests and utility methods in those test classes.    For asserts() or things like that, look in the JUnit library or Mockito library, which is already included in the project as a dependency.       If you cannot find the operation you’re looking for after searching through these sources, then look for a reputable third-party library. *   *In the real world, you’d probably have to evaluate this as a tradeoff with your team.  Depending on the company and size of the project you’re working on, sometimes it might be less risky to just build something from scratch.     Build from scratch.  Additional Resources: I had Effective Java, Third Edition by Joshua Bloch reccommended to me early in my career, and I still reference it regularly.  The Third Edition was updated for the Java 8 release, and its still relevant for the newer Java versions.  It does an excellent job of delineating those principles of good design and effective programming that can appear amongst more experienced programmers to be a-priori. "
