# Brooke Blog

Welcome to the `~code~` behind my [blog](https://brookekryan.com/)! 



## How to View on Local Server

1. In terminal, navigate to the directory where your `brooke-blog` source code is located.

2. Run the command `bundle exec jekyll serve --verbose`.

3. After about 3 seconds or so, there should be a comment that looks something like this: 

   ```
   [2022-04-21 18:18:54] DEBUG Jekyll::Commands::Serve::Servlet is mounted on .
       Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
   ```

4. Open that server address into your browser of choice. (I think it usually is http://127.0.0.1:4000/ but not 100% sure if thats always the caseü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

---

### If you make a change...

5. Save your file, then wait another 3 seconds or so. 
6. Your changes *should* be visible again on the page. Sometimes, if you change an asset though, you might need to Ctrl+C and start again from step 1.

## Theme Credits

As you can see, I forked the template from the [Mundana theme](https://bootstrapstarter.com/mundana-theme-jekyll/) by [WowThemes.net](https://www.wowthemes.net/). While I did make a fair amount of changes (are all documented in the commit history) to tailor it to my needs, I am very grateful for Sal's work to create this theme. It is the only free, Medium-looking template I'm aware of, and its really beautiful. 

If you like my alterations of the template (minimalistic front page, coursework page, etc.) you are also welcome to use it, but please ensure that [Sal](https://www.wowthemes.net/donate/) (original template creator) and I are both credited somewhere.
