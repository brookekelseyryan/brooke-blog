What if we could leverage the inherent power of the collective
imagination as a medium for integrating the arts and the sciences? This
is the basic premise of The Electric Garden---the exploration of the
timeless, familiar, archetypal images of the imaginal realm as a medium
through which to teach scientific concepts.

In this report, we outline our basic design goals and
ideas, delineate the two prototypes we created, analyze
our findings and feedback, and discuss our future plans for the project.
Furthermore, through the creation of this project, we hope to provide a
grounding of theory, a blending of both the scientific and the creative,
upon which further projects of a similar vein may be explored in the
future.

### Learning Goals

We seek to design an inclusive, interactive learning experience for
makers of all ages and genders that introduces concepts found in basic
electronics and circuitry. Our goal is to encourage makers to create and
problem solve while learning artistic and scientific concepts in
between. We want to provide a learning space which allows makers to
problem-solve, reassess goals, and use their imagination to explore
possibilities, such as described by Resnick and Rosenbaum [1]. We sought to curate an exhibition that integrated this approach as a
foundation for our design.

Furthermore, we seek to expose participants to a multi-lingual learning
experience by teaching concepts in both English and Spanish. Our goals
are two-fold: primarily, we seek to reinforce our goal of including and
expanding engineering to underrepresented groups. We hope by including
this aspect of the exhibit that we will foster a more welcoming and
inclusive environment to people from Spanish-speaking communities, who
have traditionally been excluded and underrepresented in engineering.
Secondly, we believe that the connection between magic, nature, and
science encapsulated in the exhibit runs parallel to cultural themes
found in Latin America, for instance in the Latin American literary
movement of Magical Realism [6]. This cultural connection
may provide Spanish-speaking participants with an added unconscious and
imaginal benefit when participating in the exhibit, which we hope will
ultimately lead to added participation in STEM.

### Audience

Generally, our project audience is aimed to be inclusive to makers of
all ages and genders, who have limited exposure to concepts in
electronics, and particularly limited in terms of their interaction with
physical circuits. In future iterations of this project, more work
should be done to specifically determine if a particular age range
should be considered when developing these materials, or if having
limited exposure to the electronics concepts is sufficient. We also seek
to target audiences who have been traditionally underrepresented in
engineering, including girls and Latinx children.

### How to Use 

Makers of all ages will be able to interact with the exhibit by
following a short narrative embedded with a step by step guide to build
the mushroom led circuit. Each step will provide the maker with a short
introductory lesson on circuitry and hints to help them along the way.
The step by step process encourages makers to think and troubleshoot. If
makers request additional help with the steps, they are able to flip the
step by step cards and retrieve the answer to the steps. 

Step by step:
1. The Mushroom is a type of fungus that grows in the dark. But, people can't see when it is dark! So I use my "Fairy Magic" to make it bright! 
2. You can use Fairy Magic too! Here's How: Search for a "battery" in the garden. The battery is the "source" of my magic. Plug the battery into the mushroom. Does it light up?
3. For the magic of the battery to show in the mushroom, you need to create a 'circuit'! See where you should connect the 'circuit'! *Hint: Connect the positive side of the led light to one side of the battery* 
4. Name the colors of the mushrooms. Is there a meaning to their order?

## Design Mechanisms

### Initial Exhibit Prototype

For our initial exhibit prototype, we sought to curate an exhibition
that integrated the discussed Learning Goals as a foundation for our
design. The design consisted of an interactive mushroom display and an
LED circuit. Makers were introduced to the "Electric Garden - El Jardín
Eléctrico" and a short story about a mushroom fairy, who illuminates the
mushrooms in the garden with the power of science. Makers are led
through the process of building their colored LED circuit with hints and
guided steps.

During class time in Week 5, we presented The Electric Garden to the
class. We utilized the giant flowers that were produced by Kylie and the
team in order to set the scene.

We were really excited by the volume and creativity of ideas that our
classmates contributed to the exhibit, which we discuss at length in the
Design Evaluation section of our report. For our final project
prototype, we utilized these ideas and notes our classmates shared with
us to work on the next round of designing for the final project,
discussed in the following section.

### Final Project Prototype

To address feedback from the initial round of prototyping in both the
narrative aspects and presentation of scientific concepts, we decided to
make LED Glowing Mushrooms. These LED glowing mushrooms will be arranged
and presented to create a "fairy ring" (a naturally occurring ring of
mushrooms) that connects to a "magical stone", representing the battery
that powers the circuit. This also connects to the educational goal to
introduce and engage underrepresented groups.

### Design Process

In order to create our final project design prototype, we incorporated a
few new artifacts to our exhibit, namely 3D printed objects. 3D printed
objects provide a form of sensory integration by feeling textures and
shapes of objects. With our upgraded design we aim to provide a more
hands-on learning approach, and allow for further tactile exhibition,
which we hope will lead to a more immersive presentation of the
scientific concepts explored in the project.

We sough out to design a mushroom garden constructed of 3D printed
objects using translucent filament to create a glowing lamp-like effect
using the LED circuit. During our brainstorming phase we planned out our
designs along with materials we would require. Upon meeting with our 3D
printing lab we were quickly notified that access to translucent/clear
filament was not an option. We quickly redesigned our mushrooms to print
in a solid filament (white) and decided to adjust our circuit to stay
true to our initial concept. Given the solid filament, we were not able
to place the LED lights underneath the mushroom caps, instead we opted
to place the LED's on top to continue with the lamp-like effect of the
electric garden.

## Connections to Theory

Much of our project design philosophy is rooted in Papert's theory of
constructionism [4]. Building upon the idea of mental
construction as it pertains to learning, Papert addresses the importance
of the freedom to asking questions about the used methods and materials.
This theory encourages creators to reevaluate the notions of learning
and teaching from the way we once knew or know it to be. As Kafai
mentioned in the book *Cambridge Handbook of Learning Sciences*, many of
the challenges that continue to be faced within learning and teaching
are relevant in the learning sciences [5].

## Connections to Arts, Making, and Engineering

Our design approach began as a playful brainstorming session of unique
learning ideas incorporating elements of art, computer science, and
education. Mitchel Resnick and Eric Rosenbaum mentioned in their chapter
"Designing for tinkerability", the many pathways to making things while
creating a richer learning experience. Resnick and Rosenbaum introduced
the tinker approach, which is characterized by play, iteration, and
experimental styles. Allowing makers to problem solve, reassess goals
and use imagination to explore possibilities [1].

## Design Evaluation 

Throughout the quarter, we had a few rounds of design evaluation that
helped inform the subsequent design process and evaluation for the next
prototype created.

### Week 5 Exhibit Feedback 

The feedback we received from our classmates during the Week 5 Exhibit
presentations were primarily categorized into two sections: (i)
Expansion of Narrative, and (ii) Presentation of Scientific Concepts.

**(i) Expansion of Narrative**

Participants were drawn in and excited about the narrative elements that
we included in the exhibit, and our classmates ideated on further
expansions or areas to improve upon for further prototyping. Phebe and
Mengqi challenged us to expand on the narrative, and to incorporate
Capuleta the mushroom fairy more into the exhibit somehow. How can
empathy and helping Capuleta finish her garden be further incorporated
in the exhibit?

Lora and Santiago similarly suggested to further expand on the
narrative. Santiago pointed out the cultural significance of the themes
of magic and nature in the narrative particularly for Latino families
and children. This dovetails nicely with his suggestion to incorporate
scientific elements, such as the battery into the storyline (a magical
stone that makes the fungi glow). Both of these observations from our
classmates aptly connect to the ideas presented by Peppler et al.
regarding the importance of both empathy and narrative in engineering
activities [3]. In general, exhibit-goers also really enjoyed the
immersion into the narrative and fairy-tale world the imagery of the
mushrooms and the giant flowers provided. To further expand on that,
Lora suggested the idea that participants could "become" a provided
character of choice, such as a wizard, fairy, or a gender-neutral
character such as a toad, to allow for further immersion in the
experience.

**(ii) Presentation of Scientific Concepts**

In addition to feedback on the narrative elements, we also received some
insights and ideas for how to potentially expand the presentation of the
scientific concepts in the exhibit. One of the primary learning
objectives of the exhibit is to demonstrate concepts of basic circuitry
and electronics, similar to the lesson we encountered in class during
the E-Textiles lesson in Week 3. Some of the suggestions and ideas that
arose out of conversations with our classmates during the gallery walk
included:

-   The mushroom dome itself is conductive, and the LEDs are built-in to
    the white spots. Exhibit goers can place the white spots directly on
    intuitive spots.

-   Consider having Mushrooms of different sizes that demonstrate
    progressively more complex circuits/ electronics concepts.

-   Consider incorporating aspects of biology and life sciences into the
    lessons.

-   Incorporate the night aspect of the instructions into other aspects
    of the exhibit, maybe kids can make constellations via a similar
    placing of the LED circuit.

-   Large/ supersized mushrooms/ flowers in the corners of the room,
    which could be a "giant" circuit.

While in the context of this course we have limited time and resources
to further materialize an exhibit, these conversations suggest that
potentially a multitude of future exhibits and lessons can be explored
with the fairy-tale magical garden theme in mind.

### Guest Lecturer Feedback 

Additionally, we received feedback from our guest lecturers on our
exhibit prototype that we presented during week 5. We received this
later in the quarter, and thus were not able to incorporate it into our
Final prototype design. However for future iterations of the project, we
plan to analyze this feedback and utilize it for building our next phase
of designs. We've included this feedback in the Appendix of this report
for further reading and future reference.

### Final Project Gallery Walk Feedback

We were fortunate to receive constructive feedback from our final
project gallery walk in class. Among the positive feedback we received,
some helpful suggestions concerning the filament used for our mushrooms
were shared. Incorporating more biological concepts within the narrative
was also shared. Many critiques expressed the desire to expand the
exhibit and create a life-size version of The Electric Garden. The
following are feedback we received from the final project gallery walk:

-   Suggestions about printing the mushrooms in clear resin with a mold.

-   Creating a life-size interactive version of the exhibit.

-   Incorporating biological concepts about mushrooms into the
    narrative. Providing a curriculum using mushrooms to model
    engineering.

-   Including the first prototype into the exhibit along with the mini
    mushrooms. Suggestions on incorporating e-textiles with the large
    mushroom. Creating a space where participants can interact and sew
    onto the mushroom.

-   Provide deeper narrative for non-experts in the field. Strengthen
    the connections between science and magic. Build upon how science
    unlocks understanding.

### Future Directions

Ultimately, we are excited and eager to continue exploring improvements
for the exhibit. This work has demonstrated to us that by embarking on a
project incorporating these fairy-tale themes, we are not only exploring
the exhibit at hand, but the inherent magic and wonder and that exists
in our own collective electric garden through this powerful and
universal fairy tale imagery.
